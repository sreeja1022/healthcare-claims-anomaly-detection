🏥 Healthcare Claims Anomaly Detection
This project analyzes Medicare Part D prescription claims data to identify potential anomalies that may indicate fraud, waste, or abuse. By applying unsupervised machine learning algorithms, we aim to flag unusual billing patterns and enhance claim verification processes.

🚀 Project Objective
To detect outlier patterns in healthcare claims using anomaly detection techniques like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF)—helping reduce financial losses and support proactive fraud prevention.
